âš¡ Key Projects:

Recipe Web Application: https://github.com/xinyiluo448/COMS4111-BestRecipes/
Developed a full-stack web application using Flask, enabling:

User account creation and session management with role-based permissions for recipe interactions, including creation, claiming, deletion, likes, and reviews.
Integration of a third-party Recipe API, populating a PostgreSQL database hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Efficient data manipulation via SQLAlchemy and execution of raw SQL queries.
This project combines backend expertise, third-party API integration, and database management to deliver a dynamic, user-centric recipe platform.

Surprise Gift Campaign Analysis at EstÃ©e Lauder: https://github.com/estee-lauder-1a/ai-studio-project

As an Artificial Intelligence Studio Fellow at The EstÃ©e Lauder Companies, I worked on analyzing the impact of marketing campaigns through advanced probabilistic modeling:

Designed and implemented Bayesian Regression Discontinuity Design to evaluate surprise gift campaigns on customer spending.
Leveraged NumPyro for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling, providing credible intervals to assess campaign ROI and inform strategic decisions.
Collaborated closely with senior data scientists, delivering data-driven insights to optimize marketing strategies.
This project showcases expertise in Bayesian statistics, probabilistic programming, and practical applications of AI/ML in business settings.
