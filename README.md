## Hi, I'm TaabeerðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Sophomore at Barnard College of Columbia University studying Computer Science

Iâ€™m passionate about combining machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and innovative web development to tackle complex challenges. Whether itâ€™s optimizing customer campaigns or creating user-friendly applications, I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity.

ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Surprise Gift Campaign Analysis at Estee Lauder

What I Did: Designed and implemented an advanced analysis framework to evaluate marketing campaigns at The EstÃ©e Lauder Companies.

Key Features:
Developed a Bayesian Regression Discontinuity Design to quantify the impact of surprise gift campaigns on customer spending.
Used NumPyro for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) probabilistic modeling, generating credible intervals to assess ROI.
Collaborated with senior data scientists to deliver actionable insights, supporting strategic decision-making.
Tools: Python, NumPyro, Bayesian Statistics
Learnings: Gained expertise in probabilistic modeling, customer behavior analysis, and data-driven marketing strategies.
